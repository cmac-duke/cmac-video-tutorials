						<p>Computational Media, Arts & Cultures represents a collection of related activities at Duke University. Originating in the Department of Art, Art History & Visual Studies and the Mellon-supported Visual Studies Initiative, CMAC has evolved to include various graduate programs and collaborative research initiatives. These include an MA track in Computational Media within the Department of Art, Art History & Visual Studies, a Graduate Certificate offered by the Information Science + Studies Program, and an interdisciplinary PhD program co-sponsored by Art, Art History & Visual Studies, the Literature Program, the Franklin Humanities Institute, and Information Science + Studies.	</p><br>

						<p>CMAC is housed in the historic Smith Warehouse at Duke. Our home base of operations is in Bay 10, where many of the interdisciplinary labs associated with CMAC are are located. These labs form a part of the Media Arts + Sciences Consortium, which also includes international partners focused on various aspects of our activities.</p><br>

						<p>The extended CMAC community includes faculty, staff, and students from all over campus and beyond. We are tied closely to the Franklin Humanities Institute Digital Humanities Initiative and PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge, the Information Initiative, Bass Connections, and other innovative projects on campus. We offer our students ways to formalize their participation in such activities as part of their coursework and thesis projects.</p><br>
